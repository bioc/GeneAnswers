NEW FEATURES

    o New function getListGIF is added to interact with ListGIF web server 
    (http://listgif.nubic.northwestern.edu). ListGIF provides a comprehensive 
    analysis solution to identify the overrepresented biomedical concepts from 
    a list of query genes. Result is rendered as a wordle.

BUG FIXES

    o Reactome hyperlink has been fixed.

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0.0
----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Reactome pathway analysis is based on local reactome.db. The previous
    xml queries had been disabled.

BUG FIXES

    o Completely support igraph. igraph0 is not supported, which means the 
    nodes index starts at 1, not 0 in igraph0 or less than 0.6.x version igraph.

    o GO.CC and GO.MF level specified test had been fixed.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.14.0
----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Multigroup concept-gene analysis html report supports interactive
    network with cytoscape web support as well as original fixed images

    o caBIO pathway and REACTOME pathway are included with xml queries,
    therefore, internet access is required.

    o The total number of pooled genes in Hypergeometric test can be set
    by the amount of genes in annotation library or the total annoted 
    genes in the given species.

    o Add gene annotation summarization functions. 
    Please check geneFunctionSummarize.pdf for more details.
	

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.12.0
----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Multigroup concept-gene analysis has been added. There are
    two types of representations. One is graphics table implemented
    by function 'drawTable', another is a html file generated by
    function 'groupReport'


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.10.0
----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Shades of nodes are introduced to stand for specified values
    given in the geneInput slot.

    o Statistical significant Ontology structure of given terms 
    can be displayed by function 'geneAnswersConceptRelation' so that
    users can find more appropriate concepts in the significant
    concept list.
